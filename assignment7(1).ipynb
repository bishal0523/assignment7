    "#Q1. What is Abstraction in OOps? Explain with an example.\n",
    "#Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that focuses on representing the essential features and behaviors of an object while hiding unnecessary details. It allows you to create abstract classes or interfaces that define a common set of methods that derived classes must implement.\n",
    "#In OOP, abstraction helps in managing complexity and provides a high-level view of the system. It enables modular design and implementation by separating the interface (what an object does) from the implementation (how it does it).\n",
    "#An abstract class cannot be instantiated directly; it serves as a blueprint for derived classes. It can contain both abstract methods (methods without an implementation) and concrete methods (methods with an implementation). The abstract methods must be implemented by any class that inherits from the abstract class.\n",
